We have some exciting \\r\\nupdates and progress to announce.\\r\\n\\r\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\r\\n\\r\\n# Current status\\r\\n\\r\\nWe are addressing most wanted features and improvements for this release, we took all of this seriously and \\r\\nrewritten core codebase from ground-up. At the moment of writing this devlog, new core is waiting to be \\r\\nintegrated into our main codebase and connected with the UI. \\r\\n\\r\\nSimultaneously we were working on 3 big features, palettes, shortcuts and search. One of them (palette system)\\r\\nis already available on development channel and you can test it yourself!\\r\\n\\r\\nLet\'s dive into the details.\\r\\n\\r\\n# Palette system\\r\\n\\r\\nPalettes are extremely important for good drawings, and up until now, we only had swatches system, which\\r\\nsimply saved colors that were used on canvas while drawing. Comparing swatches to palettes in PixiEditor 1.0\\r\\nis like trying to compare a raft with a yacht. It literally took _months_ of development time.\\r\\n\\r\\nInterested? Let\'s break things down!\\r\\n\\r\\n## Palette Viewer\\r\\n\\r\\nPalette Viewer is similar to the Swatches tab, it stores current palette and allows to manage it.\\r\\n\\r\\n![palette-viewer](/img/blog-posts/devlog2/Palette-viewer.png)\\r\\n\\r\\nWe can see a few things there. \\r\\n\\r\\nTop bar contains buttons to add colors, copy swatches into palette, open palette browser, import palette\\r\\nfrom disk and save palette.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen, there are colors! Who would\'ve guess? Click on them to select as a primary drawing color.\\r\\nYou might\'ve noticed that first 10 colors contain some numbers, from 1 to 0, they are, in fact, shortcuts.\\r\\n\\r\\nClicking 1 on keyboard will select first color as your primary, simple, yet time-saving. But don\'t worry, \\r\\nthey are more quality of life features.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last, bottom bar, this one is a little mysterious at first glance.\\r\\nIt\'s a color replacer. Drag color to a first field, click on second to pick desired color and hit replace button.\\r\\nNot only it will replace color in palette, but also on the canvas!\\r\\n\\r\\n<video class=\\"blog-video\\" controls>\\r\\n  <source src=\\"/img/blog-posts/devlog2/Color-replacer.mp4\\" type=\\"video/mp4\\"/>\\r\\n  Your browser does not support the video tag.\\r\\n</video>\\r\\n\\r\\n## Palette Browser\\r\\n\\r\\nPalette Browser is a place, where you can find all stored palettes, from the ones you\'ve created, to the ones downloaded from the internet.\\r\\n\\r\\n![palette-browser](/img/blog-posts/devlog2/Palette-Browser.png)\\r\\n\\r\\nLookin\' good, doesn\'t it?\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst thing, you can see all palettes in the list. You can also search for palettes by name, filters and mark them as favorite. You can also import\\r\\nthem from your palette viewer, disk or ...import directly from [Lospec](https://lospec.com/palette-list) by clicking \\"Open in app\\" button.  \\r\\n\\r\\nHere is how it looks in action:\\r\\n\\r\\n<video class=\\"blog-video\\" controls>\\r\\n  <source src=\\"/img/blog-posts/devlog2/Lospec-Import.mp4\\" type=\\"video/mp4\\"/>\\r\\n  Your browser does not support the video tag.\\r\\n</video>\\r\\n\\r\\n## Other features\\r\\n\\r\\n- Context menu quick palette color picker:\\r\\n\\r\\n![context-menu](/img/blog-posts/devlog2/Context-menu.png)\\r\\n\\r\\n- Jasc palette file format support\\r\\n- CSP (Clip Studio Paint) file format support\\r\\n\\r\\n# Command Manager\\r\\n\\r\\nCommand Manager is a quality of life feature, that gives the user ability, to quickly search for different actions. Simillar to Visual Studio Code.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Search\\r\\n\\r\\nSearch lets you do everything you can do inside of PixiEditor, with just one search bar.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor example, you can quickly open any recently opened file, do most of the things you do with your mouse, but more quickly and it has some nice extra features for making you more productive.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo open it, just click on the new search bar at the top of the window or press the shortcut, which is set to Ctrl + K by default.\\r\\n\\r\\n![search-open](/img/blog-posts/devlog2/Search-open.png)\\r\\n\\r\\nThis opens up the new search bar.\\r\\n\\r\\n<img src=\\"/img/blog-posts/devlog2/Search-window.png\\" class=\\"blog-c80\\"/>\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is really powerful, and there\'s more.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Color Input\\r\\n\\r\\nYou can quickly type in colors to select them in the color picker.\\r\\n\\r\\n![search-set-hex](/img/blog-posts/devlog2/Search-set-hex.png)\\r\\n\\r\\n![search-set-rgb](/img/blog-posts/devlog2/Search-set-rgb.png)\\r\\n\\r\\n#### Pro tips:\\r\\n\\r\\n#1 Press Ctrl + R to quickly insert the rgb pattern.\\r\\n\\r\\n#2 Just press space in the rgb pattern after typing in a number to go to the next value.\\r\\n\\r\\n#3 Press Ctrl + S to switch between rgb and hex.\\r\\n\\r\\n### File Path\\r\\n\\r\\nYou can type in a path to a file to open it.\\r\\n\\r\\n![search-kenobi](/img/blog-posts/devlog2/Search-kenobi.png)\\r\\n\\r\\n#### Pro tip:\\r\\n\\r\\nAs you can see in the screenshot, by starting the path with a \'~\' you can start from your users directory.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Customizable Shortcuts\\r\\n\\r\\nYes! They\'re finally here.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou can now customize all your favorite shortcuts in a new neat section in the settings.\\r\\n\\r\\n![shortcuts-keybinds](/img/blog-posts/devlog2/Shortcuts-keybinds.png)\\r\\n\\r\\nYou can also also import all the shortcuts from your old favorite pixel art editor to your new favorite pixel art editor.\\r\\n\\r\\n![shortcuts-imports](/img/blog-posts/devlog2/Shortcuts-imports.png)\\r\\n\\r\\nCurrently, there\'s only Aseprite, but we will add more inferior editors in the future.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Rewrite of PixiEditor\'s core\\r\\n\\r\\nHey all, this section was written by [@Equbuxu](https://github.com/Equbuxu). Since around the middle of february I\'ve been working on a complete revamp of a large part of the codebase. \\r\\nAll tools, e.g. pen, selection, fill, and others were implemented from scratch, and so was the system that keeps track of everything you draw to let you \\r\\nundo and redo. For the most part this is an internal change, but it already enables us to implement various new features a lot more quickly. \\r\\n\\r\\nRight now all of these changes are in a completely separate app, which we refer to as \\"the prototype\\". The UI there is intended only for testing, so don\'t be\\r\\ntoo scared of what you\'ll see below. The prototype already has a bunch of cool features that will be coming to PixiEditor, here are some of them:\\r\\n\\r\\n### Improved layers system\\r\\n\\r\\n<video width=\\"700\\" controls>\\r\\n    <source src=\\"/img/blog-posts/devlog2/Layers.mp4\\" type=\\"video/mp4\\"/>\\r\\n    Your browser does not support the video tag.\\r\\n</video>\\r\\n\\r\\nSince I was implementing layers from scratch anyway I decided to bring in the features you are probably used to from other editors. Blend modes, layer masks, \\r\\noptions to lock layer transparency and clip to layer below are now all included! I\'ve fixed a bunch of issues of the old layers system too, like folder \\r\\nopacity not being correctly applied to layers. Oh, and groups (folders) can be empty now, they won\'t disappear.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Selection that actually works\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a long time selection in PixiEditor has been missing a ton of crucial features, it was a joke really. Trying to select anything on all but the \\r\\nsmallest of canvases was a misarable experience as the app ground to a halt. You might\'ve wanted to use the selection to mask out a specific area \\r\\nto work on, and it just didn\'t work. You could draw outside of the selection just as well as inside of it, and the fill tool acted like the \\r\\nselection doesn\'t exist at all. It wasn\'t even possible to scale and rotate the selected section of the image, the best you could do is move it around, \\r\\nand even then the app acted buggy at times.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll this changed in the prototype. Performance have been massively improved, all the big and small annoyances have been taken care of, and the system as \\r\\na whole is now compareable to what you would find in other popular drawing apps.\\r\\n\\r\\n<video width=\\"700\\" controls>\\r\\n    <source src=\\"/img/blog-posts/devlog2/Lasso-Transform.mp4\\" type=\\"video/mp4\\"/>\\r\\n    Your browser does not support the video tag.\\r\\n</video>\\r\\n\\r\\nSelecting an area with a lasso and transforming it\\r\\n\\r\\n<video width=\\"700\\" controls>\\r\\n    <source src=\\"/img/blog-posts/devlog2/Selection-Clipping.mp4\\" type=\\"video/mp4\\"/>\\r\\n    Your browser does not support the video tag.\\r\\n</video>\\r\\n\\r\\nEverything you draw stays inside selection\\r\\n\\r\\n### Separate thread\\r\\n\\r\\nAll the drawing operations are now executed in a separate thread, which means (hopefully) no more \\"not responding\\" dialog boxes. At the very least, if you see one now \\r\\nit means something really went wrong, and it\'s not the selection system taking it\'s time to draw some translucent blue rectangles. Also the mouse cursor won\'t lag \\r\\ntogether with the app anymore.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Viewport improvements\\r\\n\\r\\nYou\'ll now be able to rotate and flip the viewport. \\r\\n\\r\\n<video width=\\"700\\" controls>\\r\\n    <source src=\\"/img/blog-posts/devlog2/Move-Viewport.mp4\\" type=\\"video/mp4\\"/>\\r\\n    Your browser does not support the video tag.\\r\\n</video>\\r\\n\\r\\n### Chunk system, faster drawing\\r\\n\\r\\nQuite a long time ago [@flabbet](https://github.com/flabbet) wrote an article on the dynamic bitmaps, a system that saved RAM by ignoring the empty areas on the edges of each layer. \\r\\nFor example, if you had a 1000x1000 canvas with only a small 200x200 drawing in the middle, PixiEditor wouldn\'t store the whole 1000x1000 image. Instead, the \\r\\nstored image will be small, 200x200, just enough to fit the drawing. It will be expanded if you draw more things next to what\'s already there.\\r\\n\\r\\n<video width=\\"700\\" controls>\\r\\n    <source src=\\"/videos/dynamic-bitmaps.mp4\\" type=\\"video/mp4\\"/>\\r\\n    Your browser does not support the video tag.\\r\\n</video>\\r\\n\\r\\nI decided to bring this up because now this system will be replaced by a more elaborate, but also better-designed one. Instead of just ignoring empty areas \\r\\non the edges it will now take care of the empty areas in the middle of the drawing too. For instance, if you have a big canvas and you draw a large circle \\r\\nwithout any fill only the perimeter of the circle will be stored, not the whole image which would include the empty space inside. This is done by splitting\\r\\nthe canvas into many small square images, or chunks. Each chunk is 256x256 pixels. When you create a brand new canvas it has no chunks stored internally. \\r\\nOnce you start drawing only the chunks you are drawing on are created and saved in RAM.\\r\\n\\r\\n<video width=\\"700\\" controls>\\r\\n    <source src=\\"/img/blog-posts/devlog2/Chunk-Vis.mp4\\" type=\\"video/mp4\\"/>\\r\\n    Your browser does not support the video tag.\\r\\n</video>\\r\\n\\r\\nI could write a whole article about this system, but here I just want to mention a couple more details. The chunks don\'t just sit in RAM, they are also used to render \\r\\nwhat you see on screen. What\'s cool is that the new renderer can render separate chunks in low resolution when you zoom far away. Moreover, the chunks you don\'t see\\r\\non screen don\'t get rendered. This saves a lot of computation, meaning that you can now comfortably draw on large canvases.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Moveable reference layer\\r\\n\\r\\n[@CPKreuz](https://github.com/CPKreuz) aka @PixiCPU is currently working on improving the reference layer. It will get the same transformation features as the selection. \\r\\nIn other words, the reference image used to always be in the center, and now you\'ll be able to put it precisely where you want it to be.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Symmetry\\r\\n\\r\\nThis one is pretty simple. @Moki on Discord requested a feature that mirrors everything you draw on the other side of the canvas, and now it\'s in the prototype!\\r\\n\\r\\n<video width=\\"700\\" controls>\\r\\n    <source src=\\"/img/blog-posts/devlog2/Symmetry.mp4\\" type=\\"video/mp4\\"/>\\r\\n    Your browser does not support the video tag.\\r\\n</video>\\r\\n\\r\\n# Summary\\r\\n\\r\\nAs you can see, our hands are busy, palette system, command manager and whole new prototype are basically finished. In the next few weeks,\\r\\nwe will be integrating all of it. Stay tuned!"},{"id":"/2022/05/02/drawing-contest","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2022/05/02/drawing-contest","source":"@site/blog/2022-05-02-drawing-contest.mdx","title":"\ud83c\udf89 Celebratory Drawing Contest \ud83c\udf89","description":"Celebratory drawing contest for 100th members of PixiEditor Discord server.","date":"2022-05-02T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"May 2, 2022","tags":[{"label":"pixel-art","permalink":"/blog/tags/pixel-art"},{"label":"contest","permalink":"/blog/tags/contest"}],"readingTime":0.46,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Krzysztof Krysi\u0144ski","title":"PixiEditor Creator","url":"https://krysinski.me","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25402427?s=400&v=4"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"\ud83c\udf89 Celebratory Drawing Contest \ud83c\udf89","author":"Krzysztof Krysi\u0144ski","author_title":"PixiEditor Creator","author_url":"https://krysinski.me","author_image_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25402427?s=400&v=4","tags":["pixel-art","contest"],"keywords":["pixel-art","contest","discord"],"description":"Celebratory drawing contest for 100th members of PixiEditor Discord server."},"prevItem":{"title":"V1.0 Devlog","permalink":"/blog/2022/07/04/devlog2"},"nextItem":{"title":"Devlog 1 v0.1.7","permalink":"/blog/2021/11/13/devlog1"}},"content":"\ud83c\udf89 Our Discord server is growing fast and recently we\'ve reached 100 members!

We have exciting news to share\\r\\nabout our latest version. A major rework is going on, there are lots of new features and bug fixes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\r\\n\\r\\n# What has been going on for the past few months\\r\\n\\r\\nWe\'ve decided to rework the most important part of PixiEditor, the drawing backend, from the ground up.\\r\\nThe rework will open a lot of doors for us, from a huge performance boost to an easier and quicker\\r\\ncross-platform port. Thus the version 0.1.7 mostly has performance improvements and optimizations.\\r\\nApart from that, we are working really hard on fixing existing bugs (and trying not to create more), adding\\r\\nnew and exciting features, improving UI, etc.\\r\\n\\r\\n# Port to SkiaSharp\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the v0.1.7 on, PixiEditor will use Skia as the drawing backend. Skia is an extremely performant image processing library made by Google.\\r\\nWith it, we managed to increase drawing speed to the point where a pen size of 300px is actually usable.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile those are great news we are still facing some issues that are yet to be solved for a stable release.\\r\\nAlmost every aspect of the core code was affected, and we had to rewrite a lot of crucial components, such as\\r\\nthe undo system, tools, custom layer rendering, and much more.\\r\\n\\r\\nNew versus old comparison video: \\r\\n<video class=\\"blog-video\\" controls>\\r\\n  <source src=\\"/videos/skia.mkv\\" type=\\"video/mp4\\"/>\\r\\n  Your browser does not support the video tag.\\r\\n</video>\\r\\n\\r\\n# New features\\r\\n\\r\\nPixiEditor still lacks many features, and we are adding more and more of them in each version.\\r\\nThe same goes for the one below.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Layer grouping and hierarchy\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is the biggest feature coming to v0.1.7. From now on you\'ll be able to create layer groups and\\r\\nenhance the structure of your drawings. It took us almost 4 months to implement and while it is still not perfect,\\r\\nwe are pretty happy with the way it works already.\\r\\n\\r\\n<video class=\\"blog-video\\" controls>\\r\\n  <source src=\\"/videos/groups.mkv\\" type=\\"video/mp4\\"/>\\r\\n  Your browser does not support the video tag.\\r\\n</video>\\r\\n\\r\\n## Reference layer\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother interesting feature we implemented is the reference layer. Oftentimes while testing PixiEditor\\r\\nwe noticed that it would be convenient to have a full-resolution image as a background to our drawings. That was how\\r\\nthe reference layer came to life. With this feature you\'ll be able to select any image from the disk and it will fit your canvas\\r\\nin a uniform size. \\r\\n\\r\\n<video class=\\"blog-video\\" controls>\\r\\n  <source src=\\"/videos/reference-layer.mp4\\" type=\\"video/mp4\\"/>\\r\\n  Your browser does not support the video tag.\\r\\n</video>\\r\\n\\r\\n## Rotate and flip document/layers\\r\\n\\r\\nPretty self-explanatory. PixiEditor didn\'t have any rotation and flipping options, so now you\'ll be able\\r\\nto rotate the whole document and the individual layers (currently in 90-degree increments, a custom angle option is planned for v0.2).\\r\\n\\r\\n<video class=\\"blog-video\\" controls>\\r\\n  <source src=\\"/videos/rotate-flip.mkv\\" type=\\"video/mp4\\"/>\\r\\n  Your browser does not support the video tag.\\r\\n</video>\\r\\n\\r\\n## Magic wand tool\\r\\n\\r\\nMore tools, more selection capabilities. The magic wand tool selects an area that has the same color. Simple and effective.\\r\\n\\r\\n# Other changes and improvements\\r\\n\\r\\nWe replaced WPF Extended Toolkit zoombox with a custom one made to be more responsive and\\r\\nuser-friendly. There are a lot of new changes, and many of them are not mentioned in this post.\\r\\n\\r\\nNumerous bugs were fixed (and a few new ones were introduced as well).\\r\\n\\r\\n# Summary\\r\\n\\r\\nWe are happy with the current status of PixiEditor v0.1.7, but It\'s still not ready. New features, a reworked core, lots of \\r\\nbug fixes, new tools, and much more are waiting for the release.

It was pretty simple, however, this solution had one big downside. PixiEditor uses [WriteableBitmap](https://docs.microsoft.com/pl-pl/dotnet/api/system.windows.media.imaging.writeablebitmap?view=net-5.0)\\r\\nto manipulate bitmaps and working on bigger canvases using this solution yielded bad performance and huge memory consumption.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo what was the solution? Dynamic bitmaps!\\r\\n\\r\\n## What is a dynamic bitmap?\\r\\n\\r\\nIn simple words, a dynamic bitmap is a bitmap that fits the size of its content. This is crucial for the layer system.\\r\\nHere is a visual representation of how it works \\r\\n\\r\\n<video class=\\"blog-video\\" controls>\\r\\n  <source src=\\"/videos/dynamic-bitmaps.mp4\\" type=\\"video/mp4\\"/>\\r\\n</video>\\r\\n\\r\\n## How it works\\r\\n\\r\\nLet\'s start with a simple algorithm\\r\\n\\r\\n```\\r\\n1. Create a new bitmap with a size of 0x0 (or of any other size, depending on your usage)\\r\\n2. When set pixel is requested (for example user clicked on canvas), do the following:\\r\\n3. If the color is not transparent (if alpha is not 0):\\r\\n\\r\\n  a. If X of given coordinates is bigger than current width or Y is bigger than height, Increase size to bottom right\\r\\n\\r\\n  b. Else if new colored pixel X is smaller than 0 (relative to bitmap coordinates) or Y is smaller than 0, then increase the size to top left\\r\\n  \\r\\n4. Else If: color is transparent and coordinates already contain non-transparent pixel and after deleting them, there is a gap between content and the bitmap:\\r\\n  a. Decrease size of bitmap to fit content\\r\\n  ```\\r\\n\\r\\n  The process of resizing the bitmap is quite simple:\\r\\n\\r\\n  ```\\r\\n  1. Create a new bitmap with the desired size\\r\\n  2. Copy pixels from the current bitmap\\r\\n  3. Fill a new bitmap with the copied pixels at a calculated offset.\\r\\n  ```\\r\\n\\r\\n  However, the implementation is not trivial, it requires some calculations, like extracting the border pixels, calculating offsets,\\r\\n   checking if a coordinate is a border pixel and more.\\r\\n\\r\\n   ## How PixiEditor does this\\r\\n\\r\\n   Our algorithms look like this:\\r\\n\\r\\n   ```csharp\\r\\n        public void DynamicResize(BitmapPixelChanges pixels)\\r\\n        {\\r\\n            if (pixels.ChangedPixels.Count == 0)\\r\\n            {\\r\\n                return;\\r\\n            }\\r\\n\\r\\n            ResetOffset(pixels);\\r\\n            Tuple<DoubleCords, bool> borderData = ExtractBorderData(pixels);\\r\\n            DoubleCords minMaxCords = borderData.Item1;\\r\\n            int newMaxX = minMaxCords.Coords2.X - OffsetX;\\r\\n            int newMaxY = minMaxCords.Coords2.Y - OffsetY;\\r\\n            int newMinX = minMaxCords.Coords1.X - OffsetX;\\r\\n            int newMinY = minMaxCords.Coords1.Y - OffsetY;\\r\\n\\r\\n            if (!(pixels.WasBuiltAsSingleColored && pixels.ChangedPixels.First().Value.A == 0)) //Check if all requested pixels are transparent\\r\\n            {\\r\\n                if ((newMaxX + 1 > Width && Width < MaxWidth) || (newMaxY + 1 > Height && Height < MaxHeight))\\r\\n                {\\r\\n                    IncreaseSizeToBottomAndRight(newMaxX, newMaxY);\\r\\n                }\\r\\n\\r\\n                if ((newMinX < 0 && Width < MaxWidth) || (newMinY < 0 && Height < MaxHeight))\\r\\n                {\\r\\n                    IncreaseSizeToTopAndLeft(newMinX, newMinY);\\r\\n                }\\r\\n            }\\r\\n\\r\\n            // if clip (fit bitmap to content) is requested\\r\\n            if (borderData.Item2)\\r\\n            {\\r\\n                clipRequested = true;\\r\\n            }\\r\\n        }\\r\\n\\r\\n        private void IncreaseSizeToBottomAndRight(int newMaxX, int newMaxY)\\r\\n        {\\r\\n            if (MaxWidth - OffsetX < 0 || MaxHeight - OffsetY < 0)\\r\\n            {\\r\\n                return;\\r\\n            }\\r\\n\\r\\n            newMaxX = Math.Clamp(Math.Max(newMaxX + 1, Width), 0, MaxWidth - OffsetX);\\r\\n            newMaxY = Math.Clamp(Math.Max(newMaxY + 1, Height), 0, MaxHeight - OffsetY);\\r\\n\\r\\n            ResizeCanvas(0, 0, 0, 0, newMaxX, newMaxY);\\r\\n        }\\r\\n\\r\\n        private void IncreaseSizeToTopAndLeft(int newMinX, int newMinY)\\r\\n        {\\r\\n            newMinX = Math.Clamp(Math.Min(newMinX, Width), Math.Min(-OffsetX, OffsetX), 0);\\r\\n            newMinY = Math.Clamp(Math.Min(newMinY, Height), Math.Min(-OffsetY, OffsetY), 0);\\r\\n\\r\\n            Offset = new Thickness(\\r\\n                Math.Clamp(OffsetX + newMinX, 0, MaxWidth),\\r\\n                Math.Clamp(OffsetY + newMinY, 0, MaxHeight),\\r\\n                0,\\r\\n                0);\\r\\n\\r\\n            int newWidth = Math.Clamp(Width - newMinX, 0, MaxWidth);\\r\\n            int newHeight = Math.Clamp(Height - newMinY, 0, MaxHeight);\\r\\n\\r\\n            int offsetX = Math.Abs(newWidth - Width);\\r\\n            int offsetY = Math.Abs(newHeight - Height);\\r\\n\\r\\n            ResizeCanvas(offsetX, offsetY, 0, 0, newWidth, newHeight);\\r\\n        }\\r\\n\\r\\n        private void ResizeCanvas(int offsetX, int offsetY, int offsetXSrc, int offsetYSrc, int newWidth, int newHeight)\\r\\n        {\\r\\n            int iteratorHeight = Height > newHeight ?
