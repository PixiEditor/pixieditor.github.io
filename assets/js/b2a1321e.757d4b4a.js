You can access it using the searchbar on top or by pressing Ctrl+K.\r\n- You can set your own shortcuts now. If you are used to the ones from Aseprite, you can load the aseprite shortcut template without changing them manually.\r\n\r\n\tSelection:\r\n- Improved the performance of all selection tools\r\n- Added a way to transform the selected area in different ways (move, rotate, stretch, shear, perspective)\r\n- You can now move and rotate shapes before applying them\r\n- Added a lasso tool\r\n- You can't draw outside selection now\r\n- You can now invert selection\r\n\r\n\tLayer Manager:\r\n- Added a slider for layer opacity\r\n- Added layer blend modes\r\n- Added lock alpha, a feature that prevents you from drawing on the transparent portions of the layer.\r\n- Added layer masks\r\n- Added clipping to layer below\r\n- Groups are now called folders and they can now be empty\r\n\r\n\tPalettes:\r\n- Added a palette system. You can now import palettes from lospec, save and load them from files. The palette browser has all the palettes you have in PixiEditor.\r\n- You can use the replace color feature of the palette to replace some color with another on the whole canvas\r\n\r\n\tReference layer:\r\n- The reference layer is now saved in .pixi along with the rest of the drawing\r\n- You can now move the reference layer around, rotate it, and put it above or below your drawing\r\n\r\n\tOther:\r\n- Added symmetry, a feature that automatically mirrors everything you draw to the other side of the canvas\r\n- Added percentage scaling to the export menu, along with a hint saying what percentage might be the best.\r\n- Added a thing that shows the currently selected color in the bottom left corner\r\n- You can now rotate and mirror the viewport (in a way that doesn't affect your drawing, it only affects how you see it in PixiEditor)\r\n- Added a wrench button in the top right corner which contains some useful viewport settings\r\n- You can now open the same file in multiple windows, and the windows will update in real time\r\n- The default transparent checkboard background is now less trippy\r\n- Added an About window with all the info about the project\r\n- The shape of the brush is now shown as a contour\r\n- Added ways to rotate and flip the canvas\r\n- Floodfill now takes all layers into account if you hold down Ctrl\r\n- Moved the \"Copy Main Color\" button into the color picker window. The button is used to set the fill color of a shape to be the same as the currently selected color.\r\n- Updated Discord rich presense preview to the new design of Discord in settings\r\n- The color picker tool can now pick colors from just the current layer, without taking the ones underneath into account.\r\n\r\nFixes:\r\n- The mouse pointer no longer lags when launching PixiEditor\r\n- If you had many layers and tried deleting or creating one, PixiEditor used to lag. This is now fixed.\r\n- Fix crash when saving a file with a filename ending in .mod\r\n- PixiEditor should no longer completely stop responsing during long operations, instead it should show a loading animation\n"})})]})}function c(e={}){const{wrapper:t}={...(0,r.a)(),...e.components};return t?(0,i.jsx)(t,{...e,children:(0,i.jsx)(d,{...e})}):d(e)}},2372:(e,t,o)=>{o.d(t,{Z:()=>i});const
